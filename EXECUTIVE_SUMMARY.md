# Customer Churn Analysis: Executive Summary

**Project:** Predictive Analytics for Customer Retention  
**Date:** October 23, 2024  
**Prepared for:** Data Science Professionals & Technical Leadership

---

## Executive Overview

This analysis addresses **customer churn**, which currently costs the bank **$4.1M annually** (2,038 churned customers × $2,000 average CLV). With a baseline churn rate of 20.4%, we analyzed 10,000 customer records through a three-stage methodology—Exploratory Data Analysis, Survival Analysis, and Machine Learning—to identify churn drivers and build a production-ready predictive model.

**Critical Findings:** Five key patterns emerged. (1) **Complaint status is near-certain churn** (99.5% churn rate)—prevention is critical. (2) **Product count exhibits a "Goldilocks effect"**—2 products is optimal (7.6% churn), while 3-4 products are catastrophic (100% churn). (3) **Age 51-60 is peak vulnerability** (56.2% churn, 7.94× Cox hazard ratio)—pre-retirement customers require specialized retention. (4) **Inactive members have 1.88× higher churn**—the strongest modifiable behavioral factor. (5) **Germany market has 2× higher churn** than France/Spain—a market-specific failure requiring investigation.

**Predictive Model:** Our Random Forest classifier achieves 85.9% accuracy and 62.5% F1-score, identifying 236 of 408 at-risk customers (58% recall) before they churn. The model successfully captures pre-complaint signals through age, product count, and activity status—enabling proactive intervention rather than reactive damage control. SHAP analysis confirms these features as the dominant churn drivers with quantified contributions to individual predictions.

**Recommendations & ROI:** Four priority interventions—(1) product portfolio cap at 2, (2) age 50+ lifecycle program, (3) inactive member re-engagement, and (4) Germany market fixes—will save an estimated 480 customers annually ($960K retained). Year 1 requires $1.175M investment (-18% ROI), but Years 2-3 deliver +$320K annual profit (breakeven achieved). Priority 1 (product cap) alone delivers 4.9× Year 1 ROI. Additionally, complaint prevention (not in main ROI) represents $812K hidden opportunity. **Executive decision:** Proceed with phased rollout, prioritizing quick wins (product cap + model deployment) to fund longer-term programs.

## Business Problem

Customer retention is critical for sustainable profitability in banking—acquiring a new customer costs 5-7× more than retaining an existing one. Our current 20.4% annual churn rate (2,038 customers) represents $4.1M in lost lifetime value and increases acquisition pressure. Without predictive intervention, we're operating reactively—addressing churn only after complaints are filed, when retention is nearly impossible (99.5% of complainers churn).

**Project Objectives:**
1. **Identify** the statistical drivers of churn through multi-method analysis (EDA, survival analysis, ML)
2. **Quantify** feature-specific risk through hazard ratios and SHAP values
3. **Predict** individual customer churn probability with 85%+ accuracy
4. **Prescribe** targeted retention strategies with measurable ROI projections
5. **Deploy** a production-ready model enabling proactive intervention before complaints escalate

- **Conclusion:** Class weight approach more efficient and resource-conscious

**Experiment 3: Feature Engineering**
- Baseline Features: 62.52% F1-Score (13 features) ✓ BEST
- Engineered Features: 62.09% F1-Score (27 features, +14 added)
- **Conclusion:** Random Forest captures interactions automatically; explicit engineering adds noise

**Key Insights:**
- Hyperparameter tuning (4-stage grid search) was critical for Random Forest performance

## Key Findings

### Finding #1: Complaint Status is the Dominant Predictor (Correlation: 0.996)

![Complaint Impact](executive_summary_assets/07_complaint_impact.png)

**Discovery:**
- **99.5% of customers who file complaints churn** vs 0.05% of non-complainers
- **1,979× relative risk** - the strongest predictor in the entire dataset
- 20.4% of customers (2,044 out of 10,000) filed complaints
- Filing a complaint virtually guarantees customer departure

**Statistical Evidence:**
- Pearson correlation with churn: **r = 0.996** (near-perfect correlation)
- Chi-square test: p < 0.001 (highly significant)
- Effect size: Cohen's h = 4.85 (enormous effect)

**Why It Matters:**
This is not just a strong predictor - it's a **point of no return** for customer relationships. Once a complaint is filed, the customer is already lost. This suggests:
1. Complaints represent accumulated dissatisfaction, not isolated incidents
2. Complaint resolution processes may be ineffective
3. Current service quality creates irreparable damage

**Business Impact:**
- **41 potential churns per month** (assuming 2,044 complaints annually)
- If average customer lifetime value = $1,000, this represents $2M+ annual loss
- **Critical intervention point:** Prevention (not resolution) is key

**Survival Analysis Confirmation:**
Kaplan-Meier curves show **catastrophic separation** between complainers and non-complainers:
- Log-rank test: p < 0.001 (highly significant)
- Median survival for complainers: Near-zero (immediate churn)
- Cox PH hazard ratio: **exp(β) = 2,652×** when included in model
- This single feature achieves C-index = 0.92 (vs 0.74 for full model without it)

**Modeling Implication:**
This feature is **too dominant** for traditional churn models - it will overshadow all other predictors. For practical ML deployment:
- **Exclude from predictive model** (it's a lagging indicator)
- **Use as separate alert system** (immediate escalation when complaint filed)
- **Focus model on pre-complaint signals** (age, products, activity status)

---

### Finding #2: Product Count Exhibits Extreme "Goldilocks" Effect

![Products Churn Analysis](executive_summary_assets/04_products_churn_analysis.png)

**Discovery:**
A dramatic **U-shaped relationship** between product count and churn:

| Products | Customers | Churn Rate | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 1        | 5,084 (51%) | 27.7% | Under-engaged |
| **2**    | **4,590 (46%)** | **7.6%** | **OPTIMAL** |
| 3        | 266 (3%)  | 82.7% | Over-serviced |
| 4        | 60 (<1%)  | 100.0% | Complete failure |

**Statistical Evidence:**
- 2-product customers have **91% lower churn** than 3-product customers
- 4-product segment: **60 customers, 60 churned** (100% failure rate)
- Non-linear effect: Cannot be captured by linear correlation alone

**Why It Matters:**
The sweet spot is remarkably narrow - **exactly 2 products**. Moving from 2→3 products increases churn by **10.9×** (7.6% → 82.7%), suggesting:
1. **Aggressive cross-selling backfires catastrophically**
2. 3-4 products indicate forced bundling or over-servicing
3. Customers with 2 products are optimally engaged (not too few, not overwhelmed)

**Root Cause Hypotheses:**
- **Over-complexity:** 3+ products create account management burden
- **Forced sales:** Customers coerced into unwanted products
- **Product mismatch:** Wrong products for customer needs
- **Fee structure:** Multiple products = higher fees → dissatisfaction

**Business Impact:**
- **266 customers with 3 products:** 220 will likely churn (82.7% rate)
- **60 customers with 4 products:** Already 100% churned
- **Immediate action required:** Review cross-sell policies
- **Opportunity:** Migrating 3-4 product customers back to 2 could save 200+ customers

**Survival Analysis Confirmation:**

![Survival by Number of Products](executive_summary_assets/11_survival_products.png)

- **Survival curves dramatically diverge** for 3-4 products vs 1-2 products
- Log-rank test: p < 0.001 (highly significant)
- **Median survival for 2-product customers: Maximum** (best retention)
- **Median survival for 3-4 products: Near-zero** (rapid churn)
- Cox PH model shows **linear** effect (0.92× per product), but this **masks U-shape**
- Survival curves reveal true non-linear pattern that EDA discovered

**Modeling Implication:**
- Feature engineering: Create binary flag `has_optimal_products` (NumOfProducts == 2)
- Non-linear models (Random Forest, XGBoost) will capture this automatically
- Decision trees will split: Products ≤ 2 vs Products > 2
- Cox PH linear assumption inadequate for this feature

---

### Finding #3: Age Exhibits Strong Lifecycle Churn Pattern (Correlation: 0.285)

![Age Distribution Churn](executive_summary_assets/03_age_distribution_churn.png)

**Discovery:**
Clear **lifecycle-driven churn pattern** with peak vulnerability at pre-retirement:

| Age Group | Customers | Churn Rate | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 18-30     | 2,559     | 7.5%       | Highly loyal (new to banking) |
| 31-40     | 2,808     | 11.9%      | Stable (career building) |
| 41-50     | 2,402     | 33.5%      | **Elevated risk** (mid-life) |
| **51-60** | **1,717** | **56.2%**  | **CRITICAL PEAK** |
| 61-70     | 442       | 31.4%      | Still elevated |
| 70+       | 72        | 8.3%       | Return to loyalty |

**Statistical Evidence:**
- Pearson correlation: **r = 0.285** (moderate-strong positive)
- Age 51-60 cohort: **965 out of 1,717 churn** (absolute highest risk)
- **7.5× higher churn** at peak (56.2%) vs youngest cohort (7.5%)

**Why It Matters:**
The **51-60 age bracket represents retirement planning phase** where customers:
1. Consolidate accounts at primary bank
2. Move assets into retirement vehicles (401k, IRA)
3. Switch to banks offering better retirement products
4. Seek financial advisory services not provided

This is a **predictable, demographic-driven attrition pattern** tied to life stage.

**Root Cause Hypotheses:**
- Lack of retirement-focused product offerings
- Competitors (e.g., Fidelity, Vanguard) offer better retirement planning
- No dedicated relationship managers for high-net-worth pre-retirees
- Fee structures punitive for large account consolidations

**Business Impact:**
- **1,717 customers in 51-60 bracket:** 965 will churn (56.2%)
- If these are high-balance customers, revenue impact is outsized
- **Lifetime value at risk:** Pre-retirees often have highest account balances

**Survival Analysis: Cox PH Quantification**

The Cox Proportional Hazards model reveals the **precise hazard ratios** for each age group (vs baseline 18-30):

| Age Group | Hazard Ratio (exp(β)) | P-value | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|----------------|
| **51-60** | **7.94×** | < 0.005 | **HIGHEST RISK** - 7.94× churn hazard |
| 61-70     | 5.12×    | < 0.005 | Second highest risk |
| 41-50     | 4.31×    | < 0.005 | Mid-life elevated risk |
| 31-40     | 1.61×    | < 0.005 | Moderate increase |
| 70+       | 1.30×    | 0.40    | Not significant (small n=72) |
| 18-30     | 1.00×    | —       | Baseline (best retention) |

**Key Survival Insight:**  
The **51-60 cohort has nearly 8× the churn hazard** of young adults. This is the **dominant demographic pattern** in the Cox model (C-index: 0.74). The lifecycle risk escalates from 18-30 → peaks at 51-60 → declines after retirement.

**Survival Curves:**

![Survival by Age Groups](executive_summary_assets/10_survival_age_groups.png)

- Clear separation between age groups in Kaplan-Meier curves
- 51-60 curve drops steeply (rapid churn)
- 18-30 curve remains high (excellent retention)
- Log-rank test: p < 0.001 (highly significant)

**Modeling Implication:**
- Age groups as dummy variables capture non-linear lifecycle pattern
- Interaction terms: Age × Balance, Age × Tenure may reveal high-value targets
- **51-60 segment requires dedicated retention model/strategy**

---

### Finding #4: Activity Status Strongly Predicts Churn (Correlation: -0.156)

![Active Member Impact](executive_summary_assets/05_active_member_impact.png)

**Discovery:**
- **Inactive members:** 26.9% churn rate
- **Active members:** 14.3% churn rate
- **1.88× relative risk** for inactive vs active

**Statistical Evidence:**
- Pearson correlation: **r = -0.156** (negative = protective effect)
- 48.5% of customer base is inactive (4,849 out of 10,000)
- Inactive segment contributes **1,305 of 2,038 total churns** (64% of all churn)

**Why It Matters:**
Activity status is the **strongest modifiable behavioral predictor**:
1. Unlike age or gender, activity can be influenced
2. Re-engagement campaigns have clear target population (4,849 inactive)
3. Inactivity may be early warning signal of churn intent

**Surprising Cross-Finding:**
Activity rate **increases with age**:
- 18-30 age group: ~50% active
- 70+ age group: ~90% active

This helps explain why elderly customers are loyal despite general age-related churn - they're highly engaged.

**Business Impact:**
- **4,849 inactive members:** 1,305 will churn (26.9%)
- **Opportunity:** If re-activation campaigns move 20% of inactive → active, could save ~225 customers annually
- **Low-hanging fruit:** Unlike demographic factors, engagement is actionable

**Recommended Interventions:**
- Quarterly re-engagement campaigns (email, phone outreach)
- Gamification: Rewards for account activity
- Personalized offers based on transaction history
- Mobile app push notifications for dormant accounts

**Survival Analysis: Strongest Protective Factor**

![Survival by Activity Status](executive_summary_assets/12_survival_active_status.png)

Cox PH model identifies **active membership as the strongest modifiable protective factor**:
- **Hazard Ratio: 0.54** (p < 0.005)
- **Interpretation:** Active members have **46% lower churn risk** (1 - 0.54 = 0.46)
- **Inverse hazard:** Inactive members have **1.85× higher risk** (1/0.54)
- **Survival curves:** Clear, sustained separation over entire tenure period
- **Log-rank test:** p < 0.001 (highly significant)

**Key Insight:** Unlike age (unmodifiable), activity status is **actionable**. Re-engagement campaigns directly target this factor.

**Modeling Implication:**
- Binary feature: Easy for models to split on
- Interaction terms: Activity × Age, Activity × Products may reveal segments
- Monitor as leading indicator: Activity decline → churn risk increase
- **Priority feature for intervention targeting**

### Finding #5: Germany Market Has 2× Higher Churn (Geographic Disparity)

![Geography Churn](executive_summary_assets/06_geography_churn.png)

**Discovery:**
Stark geographic churn disparity:

| Country | Customers | Churn Rate | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| France  | 5,014 (50%) | 16.2%    | Baseline market |
| Spain   | 2,477 (25%) | 16.7%    | Similar to France |
| **Germany** | **2,509 (25%)** | **32.4%** | **2× HIGHER** |

**Statistical Evidence:**
- Germany vs France/Spain: **32.4% vs 16.4% average** (97% increase)
- 814 churns from 2,509 German customers (absolute highest segment)
- Chi-square test: p < 0.001 (highly significant geographic effect)

**Why It Matters:**
Germany represents **25% of customer base** but contributes **40% of total churn** (814 of 2,038). This is not a small regional variation - it's a **systemic market failure** requiring investigation.

**Root Cause Hypotheses:**
1. **Competitive landscape:** German fintech market more mature (N26, Revolut, Deutsche Bank)
2. **Regulatory differences:** German banking regulations or consumer protection laws
3. **Service quality:** Operational issues specific to Germany (language, support)
4. **Product-market fit:** Offerings don't align with German customer preferences
5. **Cultural factors:** German customers have different banking expectations

**Business Impact:**
- **814 German customer churns** = 40% of total churn from 25% of base
- If churn could be reduced to France levels (16.2%), would save **~400 customers annually**
- **Revenue risk:** If German customers have similar CLV to others, this is a major leak

**Recommended Investigations:**
- Market research: Why do German customers leave?
- Competitive analysis: What do N26, Revolut, Deutsche Bank offer that we don't?
- Service audit: Is German customer support adequately staffed/trained?
- Product localization: Do offerings match German market needs?

**Survival Analysis: Germany Hazard Quantification**

![Survival by Geography](executive_summary_assets/13_survival_geography.png)

Cox PH model quantifies the Germany effect:
- **Germany Hazard Ratio: 1.60×** (p < 0.005) vs France (baseline)
- **Spain Hazard Ratio: 1.05×** (p = 0.38, not significant) vs France
- **Interpretation:** German customers have **60% higher churn risk** than French customers
- **Survival curves:** Germany separates downward, France/Spain track together
- **Log-rank test:** p < 0.001 (highly significant geographic effect)

**Key Insight:** The problem is **Germany-specific**, not a general European issue. Spain and France perform identically, suggesting a localized market failure in Germany.

**Modeling Implication:**
- One-hot encode geography: `geography_Germany`, `geography_Spain` (France = baseline)
- Interaction terms: Germany × Age, Germany × Products may reveal specific segments
- Segment-specific models: Consider training separate model for Germany
- **High-priority investigation:** Root cause analysis for German market

---

### Survival Analysis Summary: Additional Findings

Beyond the top 5 findings, survival analysis revealed additional insights:

#### Gender Effect (Moderate)
- **Female Hazard Ratio: 1.47×** (p < 0.005)
- Female customers have **47% higher churn risk** than males
- Statistically significant but moderate effect size
- May warrant gender-specific retention messaging

#### Balance Paradox (Counterintuitive)
- **Zero-balance accounts:** 13.8% churn vs **Non-zero balance:** 24.1% churn
- Cox PH shows **minimal effect** (HR ≈ 1.00, p < 0.005 but practically negligible)
- **Hypothesis:** Zero-balance accounts may be "parking" accounts customers intentionally maintain
- Survival curves show better retention for zero-balance segment
- **Implication:** Balance alone is not a strong churn predictor

#### Tenure (Modest Protective)
- Longer tenure → slightly lower churn risk
- But effect is modest compared to age/activity factors
- Customer loyalty builds gradually over time

#### Cox PH Model Performance
- **C-index: 0.74** (Good discriminative ability)
- **Features excluded:** Complaint (too dominant, exp(β)=2,652×), Age continuous (multicollinearity with age_group)
- **Features included:** Gender, tenure, balance, numofproducts, isactivemember, geography, age_group (dummy variables)
- **Use case:** Individual customer risk scoring, CLV estimation, targeted intervention prioritization

## Predictive Model Performance

### Model Architecture & Optimization

**Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (ensemble of 900 decision trees)

**Final Hyperparameters** (optimized via grid search):
- `n_estimators=900` (number of trees)
- `max_depth=11` (tree depth limit - prevents overfitting)
- `criterion=gini` (split quality measure)
- `max_features=None` (consider all features per split)
- `min_samples_split=4` (minimum samples to split node)
- `min_samples_leaf=1` (minimum samples per leaf)
- `class_weight={0:1, 1:2}` (2× penalty for missing churners - addresses class imbalance)

**Why these parameters matter:**
- `max_depth=11` reduced overfitting from 15% to 7% train-test gap
- `class_weight={0:1, 1:2}` boosted recall from 48% to 58% (+21% improvement)
- Grid search tested 73 total hyperparameter combinations over 4 sequential stages

### Business Impact Translation

![PDP: Age](executive_summary_assets/18_pdp_age.png)

![PDP: Number of Products](executive_summary_assets/19_pdp_numofproducts.png)

**Current Model Capabilities:**

**Customers Correctly Identified:**
- **True Positives:** 236 churners correctly flagged (out of 408 total)
- **True Negatives:** 1,481 loyal customers correctly identified (out of 1,592 total)
- **Total Correct:** 1,717 customers out of 2,000 (85.85% accuracy)

**Model Errors:**
- **False Positives:** 111 false alarms (predicted churn, but stayed)
  - **Business cost:** Unnecessary retention efforts (acceptable trade-off)
  - **False alarm rate:** 111 / (111 + 1,481) = 7.0%
- **False Negatives:** 172 missed churners (predicted stay, but churned)
  - **Business cost:** Lost opportunity for retention intervention
  - **Miss rate:** 172 / 408 = 42.2% (still missing 42% of churners)

**Recall (58%) Deep Dive:**
- Catching **236 out of 408 churners** before they leave
- **+41 churners identified** vs baseline (195 → 236)
- Trade-off: Excluded `complain` feature (too dominant, 99.5% churn)
- **Strategic choice:** Focus on *pre-complaint* churn signals for proactive intervention

**Precision (68%) Deep Dive:**
- Of 347 customers flagged as high-risk, **236 actually churn** (68%)
- **111 false alarms** are the cost of catching 236 real churners
- **ROI-positive:** Cost of 111 retention campaigns << value of saving 236 customers

|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Churn Rate** | 20.4% | **15.6%** | **-4.8%** (23% reduction) |
| **Customers Churned** | 2,038 | **1,560** | **-478 saved** |
| **Model Recall** | Baseline 48% | **58%** | +10% (with model) |
| **Preventable Churns** | 0 | **798** | Model identifies pre-complaint |

**Customers Saved by Initiative:**
- Priority 1 (Product Cap): **220 saves** (reduce 3-4 product churn)
- Priority 2 (Age 50+): **145 saves** (15% improvement in 51-60 retention)
- Priority 3 (Re-engagement): **122 saves** (20% reactivation rate)
- Priority 4 (Germany): **311 saves** (reduce Germany churn to 20%)
- **Total (accounting for overlap):** **~480 customers saved** in Year 1

**Revenue Retention:**
- 480 customers × $2,000 avg CLV = **$960,000 retained annually**
- 3-year value: 480 × $2,000 × 2.5 (retention multiplier) = **$2.4M**

**Total Investment Required (Year 1):**
- Priority 1: $90K
- Priority 2: $330K
- Priority 3: $230K
- Priority 4: $425K
- Model deployment & monitoring: $100K
- **Total Year 1:** **$1,175,000**

**Net Benefit:**
- **Year 1:** $960K retained - $1,175K investment = **-$215K** (investment period)
- **Year 2:** $960K retained - $640K ongoing costs = **+$320K net benefit**
- **Year 3:** $960K retained - $640K ongoing costs = **+$320K net benefit**
- **3-Year Cumulative:** **+$425K net benefit**

**ROI Analysis:**
- **Year 1 ROI:** -0.18× (investment period, expected)
- **Year 2 ROI:** 0.5× (breakeven + profit)
- **Year 3 ROI:** 0.5× (sustained profit)
- **3-Year ROI:** $2.4M value / $2.45M total investment = **0.98× ROI**
- **5-Year ROI:** Projected **2.5-3× ROI** as interventions mature

**Additional Benefits (Not Quantified):**
- Improved customer satisfaction and NPS
- Competitive advantage from better retention rates
- Data-driven culture and analytics maturity
- Reduced cost-per-acquisition (retain more, acquire less)
- Better brand reputation (fewer churned customers = fewer detractors)

---

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Optimistic Scenario** (Interventions exceed expectations):
- 25% churn reduction (vs 23% baseline) = **-5% churn rate**
- 600 customers saved annually × $2,000 = **$1.2M retained**
- **Year 1 ROI:** Break-even (0.02×)
- **3-Year ROI:** **1.5× ROI**

**Pessimistic Scenario** (Interventions underperform):
- 15% churn reduction (vs 23% baseline) = **-3% churn rate**
- 300 customers saved annually × $2,000 = **$600K retained**
- **Year 1 ROI:** -0.49× (deeper loss)
- **3-Year ROI:** **0.2× ROI** (marginal)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Phased rollout allows early course correction
- A/B testing validates intervention effectiveness before full deployment
- Priority 1 (Product Cap) has fastest payback (4.9× Year 1 ROI)
- Model deployment enables targeted interventions (avoid wasteful spend)

---

### Complaint Prevention (Critical Context)

**Note:** Our interventions focus on **pre-complaint churn signals** because:
- Complaint filers have **99.5% churn rate** (near-certain loss)
- Once complaint is filed, retention is nearly impossible
- **Prevention >>> Resolution** for complaint-driven churn

**Complaint Impact Analysis:**
- 2,044 complaint filers → 2,034 churned
- If we reduce complaints by 20% through proactive interventions (better service, early issue resolution), we save:
  - 408 fewer complaints × 99.5% churn rate = **406 additional saves**
  - 406 × $2,000 CLV = **$812K additional annual value**
- **Recommendation:** Separate complaint prevention initiative (not included in main ROI calc)

---

### Summary: Is This Worth It?

**Short Answer:** Yes, but requires patience and execution discipline.

**Key Points:**
1. **Year 1 is an investment** (-$215K), but necessary to build retention infrastructure
2. **Years 2-3 show clear ROI** (+$320K annually), with improving trends
3. **Priority 1 (Product Cap) pays for itself immediately** (4.9× ROI)
4. **Model deployment enables precision targeting** (avoid shotgun approach)
5. **Complaint prevention is the "hidden treasure"** (not in main ROI, but huge value)

**Executive Decision:** Proceed with phased rollout, starting with Priority 1 (fast ROI) and model deployment, then layer in Priorities 2-4 based on early results.

## Risks & Limitations

**Model Limitations:**
- **58% Recall (Not 100%):** Model misses 42% of churners (172 of 408). This is a strategic trade-off for pre-complaint focus, but requires supplementary monitoring.
- **Complaint Exclusion:** Model doesn't use complaint status (too dominant). Separate complaint prevention system required.
- **Temporal Drift:** Customer behavior evolves—quarterly retraining required to maintain accuracy.
- **Class Imbalance Sensitivity:** Performance depends on class_weight tuning; significant churn rate shifts require recalibration.

**Implementation Risks:**
- **Sales Resistance to Product Cap:** Sales team may resist 2-product limit (affects commissions). **Mitigation:** Show EDA evidence, create incentive structure aligned with retention.
- **Data Quality Dependencies:** Model requires clean, consistent data (missing values, encoding errors break predictions). **Mitigation:** Data validation pipeline, automated quality checks.
- **Intervention Fatigue:** Over-targeting customers with campaigns may backfire. **Mitigation:** A/B testing, frequency caps, personalization.
- **Germany Root Cause Uncertainty:** If Germany churn drivers are structural (e.g., regulatory), fixes may underperform. **Mitigation:** Early pilot, phased investment.

**Financial Risks:**
- **Year 1 Investment (-$215K):** Requires upfront capital with delayed returns. **Mitigation:** Prioritize Priority 1 (4.9× ROI) to self-fund other initiatives.
- **ROI Sensitivity:** Pessimistic scenario yields only 0.2× 3-year ROI. **Mitigation:** Phased rollout with go/no-go decision points.

## Acknowledgments

This analysis builds upon the foundational methodology developed by **Archit Desai** in his [Customer Survival Analysis and Churn Prediction](https://github.com/archd3sai/Customer-Survival-Analysis-and-Churn-Prediction) project. The original repository established the innovative approach of combining survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier estimators, Cox Proportional Hazards regression) with machine learning (Random Forest classification) for predictive churn modeling.

While the original project focused on telecom customer churn, this implementation adapts the methodology for banking sector challenges with several enhancements:
- Modular code architecture with standardized utility functions
- Comprehensive model validation experiments comparing algorithms and techniques
- Business-focused documentation with ROI projections and implementation roadmaps
- Production-ready checkpointing and reproducibility systems

The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from the [Bank Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn/data) by Radheshyam Kollipara.
